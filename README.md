# Project Title

A Drupal 7 module to log and display stats for Marvel Contest of Champions. Designed to work with Day and Night drupal theme. 

## Project Status

This is a side/"for-fun" project. It is far from perfect, and there are things in here that need serious refactoring. The project is currently in active development and is very fluid. 

## TODO / Roadmap

* [x] Create a content type to track AQ stats
* [x] Create a content type to track war stats.
* [x] Break up the content types into alliance and individual specific types.
* [x] Add a chart for overall points over time. 
* [x] Add a chart for average points by member. 
* [x] Add a chart for top 10 scores. 
* [x] Add a chart for misses by member.
* [x] Add a graph for map selection
* [x] Add a chart for exploration percentage.
* [x] Add an individual AQ stats chart to the user page. 
* [ ] Add comments to individual aq content type. 
* [ ] Add 'items used' to individual aq content type (and individual war content type. )
* [ ] Update the user names on the dashboard to link to the individual pages
* [ ] Export the content types as features.
* [ ] Add support for multiple BGs and create multiple dashboards, one for each BG
