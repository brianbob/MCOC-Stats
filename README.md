# Project Title

A Drupal 7 module to log and display stats for Marvel Contest of Champions. Designed to work with Day and Night drupal theme. 

## Project Status

This is a side/"for-fun" project. It is far from perfect, and there are things in here that need serious refactoring. The project is currently in active development and is very fluid. 

## TODO / Roadmap

* [x] Add an individual AQ stats chart to the user page. 
* [ ] Update the user names on the dashboar to link to the individual pages
* [ ] Add support for multiple BGs and create multiple dashboards, one for each BG
* [ ] Create a 'total alliance' dashboard.
* [ ] Add support for war stats?
* [ ] Refactor the individual stats into classes? (The dashboard individual chart and the /user/% chart are almost identical. CODE DUPLICATION IS BAD)
